# **Feed Reader - Jasmine testing**
===============================

## Motivation
This project was build in terms of Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. The starter code consisted of a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. My role was to write test suites.

## Test suite functionality
The feedreader.js file includes 7 specs grouped in 4 test suites. Those tests check if:
- feeds are defined
- all feeds have proper URL and names defined
- the menu is hidden by default
- the menu changes visibility on click
- there is at least a single `.entry` element
- new feeds arrive.
To run tests, open index.html in your browser. If all tests pass, the application runs properly.
